ACID is a property which is followed by the Database Professionals while preparing or evaluating the databases and the architectures 
of the applications. 
ACID stands for 
Atomicity: Atomicity is all or none i.e in a transaction involving two or more properties either all the transactions are commited or none
of them are commited. 
Consistency: This property guarantees that a transaction never leaves in a half-finished state. It either starts an entire new situation or 
goes back to its original situation but never leaves half-finished. 
Isolation: This property guarantees that no two properties are mixed while commiting and makes sure that each and every transaction is 
separated until the transaction is complete so as to get the correct and consistent data. 
Durability: This property makes sure that the changes in database is saved all the time. This helps when the database suddenly crashes or 
shuts down, then the data available will be in the same state available before the issue.
